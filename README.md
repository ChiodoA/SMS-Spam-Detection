## Introduction
This project uses a dataset of SMS messages and applies text classification to detect spam messages. The process includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature extraction using a Bag of Words approach, model training with Naive Bayes, and evaluation with performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
